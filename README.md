# Regular Expression to DFA

This project contains Python programs that demonstrate how to convert Regular Expressions (RE) into Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and validate input strings.

---

##  Files

- **Regular_Expression_to_DFA.py**  
  Converts the regular expression `(a|b)*abb` into its equivalent DFA and prints the DFA transition table.

- **Regular_Expression to DFA.py**  
  Implements a DFA for the regular expression `(0|1)*01` and validates test strings.
